/**
 * Practical Example Demonstrating Synchronization Methods in Java:
 *
 * Purpose:
 * This example demonstrates different synchronization techniques in Java to ensure thread safety
 * when multiple threads access shared resources or critical sections of code.
 *
 * Notes:
 * 1. Synchronized methods:
 *    - When a synchronized instance method is called, it acquires the lock on the current instance of the object (this).
 *    - While this lock is held, no other thread can call any other synchronized instance method on the same object instance.
 *
 * 2. Synchronized block on this:
 *    - When a synchronized block is used with synchronized (this), it also acquires the lock on the current instance.
 *    - While this lock is held, no other thread can enter any synchronized method or synchronized block that locks on this.
 *
 * 3. Static synchronized methods:
 *    - When a synchronized static method is called, it acquires the lock on the Class object associated with the class.
 *    - While this lock is held, no other thread can call any other synchronized static method on the same class.
 *
 * 4. Synchronized block on a Class object:
 *    - When a synchronized block is used with synchronized (BankAccount.class), it acquires the lock on the Class object
 *      associated with the BankAccount class.
 *    - While this lock is held, no other thread can enter any synchronized static method or synchronized block that locks on BankAccount.class.

         * Explanation of synchronization techniques:
         *
         * withDraw()/deposit() : (Synchronized method)
         * When these methods are called, the current instance (account) applies a lock on itself,
         * ensuring that no other thread can concurrently execute synchronized methods like withdraw or deposit
         * on the same account. This prevents simultaneous withdrawals or deposits that could lead to inconsistencies.
         *
         * globalDeposit() : (Static synchronized method)
         * Applies a lock at the level of static synchronized methods of the BankAccount class,
         * ensuring that no other thread can execute globalDeposit or globalWithdraw on any instance of
         * BankAccount concurrently. This prevents simultaneous global deposits or withdrawals across accounts,
         * maintaining consistent and accurate financial operations.
         *
         * transfer() : (Synchronized block on class.object)
         * Uses synchronized (BankAccount.class) to apply a lock at the class level,
         * ensuring that no other thread can simultaneously execute any synchronized block or static synchronized methods
         * (like globalDeposit) on any instance of BankAccount. This prevents concurrent transfers
         * between accounts from different instances of BankAccount, maintaining transaction integrity.
         *
         * Note: While using synchronized (BankAccount.class) ensures mutual exclusion across all instances of BankAccount,
         * it becomes less efficient as the number of instances increases. This is because all instances would contend for
         * the same class-level lock, potentially leading to increased contention and decreased concurrency.
         *
         * Private Lock Object:
         * In scenarios involving more than two instances of BankAccount, using a private lock object for each instance
         * allows for finer-grained control over synchronization. Each instance manages its own lock independently,
         * ensuring that concurrent operations on different instances do not unnecessarily block each other.
         *
         * Synchronized Block on BankAccount.class:
         * While using synchronized (BankAccount.class) ensures mutual exclusion across all instances of BankAccount,
         * it becomes less efficient as the number of instances increases. This is because all instances would contend for
         * the same class-level lock, potentially leading to increased contention and decreased concurrency.
         * In contrast, using instance-level locks (private lock objects) allows threads to operate concurrently on
         * different instances, thus improving throughput and performance in scenarios with multiple accounts.
         *
         * Conclusion:
         * For managing concurrent operations on multiple instances of BankAccount, using private lock objects provides
         * a more scalable and efficient solution compared to using synchronized blocks on class objects.
         *
         * Importance of Overriding hashCode and equals:
         * When using a private lock object, itâ€™s crucial to ensure that the lock object is unique to each instance.
         * Overriding hashCode and equals methods in the BankAccount class helps maintain the uniqueness of instances,
         * thus ensuring the correct synchronization behavior.
